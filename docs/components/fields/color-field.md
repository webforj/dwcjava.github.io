:::success **Important**
The `ColorField` class is a Field component, and as such shares all of the commonalities belonging to a Field. Please refer to the **[Field documentation page](/docs/components/fields)** for an overview of Field properties, events, and other important information.

### Constructors

The `ColorField` class has four constructors:

1. `ColorField(String label, Color color)`: Creates a `ColorField` with a given label and color.
2. `ColorField(String label)`: Creates a `ColorField` with a given label but with no pre-populated color.
3. `ColorField(Color color)`: Creates a `ColorField` with a given color, but without a label.
4. `ColorField()`: Creates a `ColorField` without any provided information.

### Color Code Format

Currently, the `ColorField` supports #rrggbb hexadecimal format. Only simple colors (without alpha channel) are allowed in the picker interface. Additionally, the `ColorField` comes along with a various methods that interact with the `java.awt.Color` class to add flexibility.

The component's presentation may vary substantially from one browser and/or platform to another. It might be a simple textual field that automatically validates to ensure that the color information is entered in the proper format, a platform-standard color picker, or some kind of custom color picker window.
