An "uncheck" event occurs when an element or checkbox is deselected or marked as "unchecked." This event is triggered when a user interacts with a checkbox, radio button, or any other form element to remove the "checked" state. It usually indicates that the associated action or state has been disabled or deactivated. This class also inherits methods from the [base `Event` class](./event)
