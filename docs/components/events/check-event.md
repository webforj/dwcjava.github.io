A "check" event occurs when an element or checkbox is selected or marked as "checked." This event is triggered when a user interacts with a checkbox, radio button, or any other form element with a "checked" state. It typically indicates that the associated action or state has been enabled or activated. This class also inherits methods from the base `Event` class.
