title: Creating an Application

Once webforJ and all applicable dependencies have been included in the POM and the desired configurations have been set, it's time to start creating an app. If you followed the previous steps, a sample `hello-world` program should be included already. This section details the various parts of the included app structure.

## Start a new application
Should you decide to create an application from scratch, you must follow a few integral steps to get the webforJ application up and running.

### Create a Java class
 
First, you need to create a new Java class. Do this by creating a `.java` file in your IDE of choice. In this demo, we'll 
create a class called **MyApplication**. 

```java
public class MyApplication {
    
}

```
### Extend the `App` class

Your new class must extend the `App` class so that webforJ can recognize it as a webforJ application.

```java
import com.webforj.App;

public class MyApplication extends App{
    
}
```

### Override the `run()` method

Next, you must override the  `run()` method. This method is where you will write the instructions for the execution of your application.

```java
import com.webforj.App;
import com.webforj.exceptions.webforJException;

public class MyApplication extends App{

    @Override
    public void run() throws webforJException { 

    }
}
```

### Create the main `Frame`

Finally, in most instances, you will need to create a `Frame` within the `run()` method or in another function called by the run method. This `Frame` is the main container for the contents of your application.

```java
import com.webforj.App;
import com.webforj.exceptions.webforJException;
import com.webforj.component.window.Frame;

public class MyApplication extends App{

    @Override
    public void run() throws webforJException { 
        Frame mainFrame = new Frame();
    }
}
```

## Customizing your application

You can then add various components that come with webforJ, custom components, elements, etc., to the `Frame`. In the example below, after the `Frame` is created, a button is added to it.

```java
import com.webforj.App;
import com.webforj.exceptions.webforJException;
import com.webforj.component.window.Frame;
import com.webforj.component.button.Button;

public class ExampleClass extends App{
    
    Button myButton = new Button("My Button");

    @Override
    public void run() throws webforJException { 
        Frame mainFrame = new Frame();
        mainFrame.add(myButton);
    }
}
```

Once you have completed these steps, you can use the [installation plugin](./configuration.md) to compile and deploy your application.

### App data

You can set the application's title, theme, and meta tags by using annotations.

```java
@AppTitle("My app title")
@AppTheme("system")
@AppMeta(name = "description", content = "My App")
@AppMeta(name = "keywords", content = "My, App, Java")

public class HelloWorld extends App {
//Implementation
}
```
