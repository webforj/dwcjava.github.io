The choice of route type determines how components are mapped to URLs and how they interact with other parts of your app.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"routing/route-navigation":{"id":"routing/route-navigation","title":"Route Navigation","description":"In webforJ, navigating between routes is the core mechanism for switching views and components based on user actions or URL changes. Navigation allows users to move seamlessly between different parts of the app without refreshing the page. This client-side navigation keeps the app responsive and smooth while preserving the app\'s state.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"routing/route-patterns":{"id":"routing/route-patterns","title":"Route Patterns","description":"Route Patterns are used to define how URLs map to specific views, including dynamic and optional segments, regular expressions, and wildcards. Route patterns enable the framework to match URLs, extract parameters, and generate URLs dynamically. They play a critical role in structuring an app\'s navigation and component rendering based on the browser\'s location.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"routing/routes-registration":{"id":"routing/routes-registration","title":"Routes Registration","description":"In addition to registering routes using the @Route annotations, it\'s possible to dynamically register, update, or remove routes at runtime based on app logic, user roles, or other conditions. This flexibility enables you to manage navigation more dynamically, rather than statically defining routes at compile time.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"routing/state-managmenet":{"id":"routing/state-managmenet","title":"State Management","description":"Creating seamless, dynamic user experiences often requires that the state of your web app be reflected in the URL and retained across browser navigation events. You can achieve this without reloading the page by leveraging URL parameter updates and browser history state management. This ensures that users can share, bookmark, or return to specific views with the app fully aware of their prior interactions.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"styling/getting-started":{"id":"styling/getting-started","title":"Getting Started","description":"Application Theme","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"styling/themes":{"id":"styling/themes","title":"Themes","description":"webforJ ships three themes by default, as well as with the ability to create your own, custom theme.
